Team Organization:

We organized the teams tasks based upon the priority of the task, in order to deliver the 
most critical functionality first, and upon each team members strengths from past projects
and experiences.

Decision Making:

Decisions were decided after considering every group members opinion in order to clear and 
confusion or concerns that may have arrisen. We also took into consideration the strengths 
of each group member to determine where they can best perform in, while also observing other 
members to learn more about aspects of project development certain other members may not be 
familiar in.

Prioritizing User Stories:

User stories were prioritized based on their priorities in order to deliver the most critical  
functionality to the project first. We determined that the ability to search for films based 
their various aspects and the ability to create an account were core features that guaranteed  
our projects most basic functional properties.

Meetings: 

Meetings were organized based upon the availability of each group member to maximize the amount 
of participants in meetings. In general, meetings were held on Discord at least twice a week, 
typically around 8pm as this was a time most comfortable with everyone. Additionally, the lab 
periods will also be used for in-person meetings, with either the first of second lab session 
on Wednesday being used.

Next Phase:

For the next phase, we will break down the tasks to get more familiar with the project, work 
towards creating functional prototypes to determine when our project is going in the right 
direction, and more frequent meetings so every member can be on the same page during the 
development process.
